## Getting and Cleaning Data Class Project
### Scripts
There is one script to run which will produce the tidy data file: run_analysis.R It expects to find the raw
UCI HAR data files in a directory named "UCI HAR Dataset" that is in the current working directory. The files in the UCI directory should be as they were when they were unzipped.

The tidy file is named tidyData.txt and is written to the current working directory.
